## Run 1

As we reflect on launching our generative-AI email assistant at a 1,500-person SaaS company, here are some key takeaways:

**What Worked:**

• **Streamlined workflows**: The AI assistant significantly reduced manual email processing time for our support team, allowing them to focus on more complex issues.
• **Improved customer engagement**: The AI's personalized email suggestions helped increase response rates and overall customer satisfaction.
• **Data-driven insights**: The AI's analytics capabilities provided valuable insights into customer behavior, informing future product development.

**What Didn’t:**

• **Initial steep learning curve**: Some users struggled to adapt to the new interface and functionality, leading to a temporary decrease in adoption.
• **Sensitivity to user input**: The AI's responses were sometimes overly reliant on user input, resulting in inaccurate or irrelevant suggestions.
• **Integration with existing tools took time**: Integrating the AI assistant with our existing customer relationship management (CRM) system was more complex than anticipated.

Based on this experience, I recommend investing in further refining the AI assistant's natural language processing capabilities to improve its accuracy and responsiveness. This would help minimize the initial learning curve and ensure a smoother user experience, ultimately driving even greater value for our customers and support team.
