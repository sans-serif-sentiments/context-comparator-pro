Migrating an on-premises database system like PostgreSQL to a managed cloud service such as AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database or Google Cloud SQL involves several operational risks that need careful consideration:

1. Data Migration Risks and Downtime: Transferring large volumes of financial data can be time-consuminous and may result in downtime which could impact the fintech startup's operations if not managed properly, potentially affecting customer trust or even causing revenue loss during peak transaction periods.
2. Cost Management: While cloud services often offer cost savings over long term usage, initial migration costs can be significant due to data transfer and setup fees; without careful budget planning this could lead to unexpected expenses that may not align with the startup's financial projections or operational cash flow expectations.
3. Security Risks: While cloud providers offer robust security features, migrating sensitive financial information increases exposure risks during transit and storage phases; additional measures like encryption might be necessary to mitigate these concerns which can add complexity in managing the migration process.
4. Compliance Requirements: Fintech firms often operate under strict regulatory compliances (like PCI-DSS, GDPR), ensuring data protection and privacy during transfer is crucial; failure to do so could result in fines or legal issues which can be costly for the startup.
5. Performance Risks: Cloud services may not always match on-premises performance due to latency introduced by network delays, impacting transaction speeds that are critical in financial operations and potentially affect customer satisfaction negatively if service levels aren't maintained or improved post migration. 
6. Vendor Lock-in Risk: Depending heavily on a single cloud provider can lead to vendor lock-in which may limit future flexibility for the startup, especially when it comes time to scale up or down based on business needs and financial performance fluctuations. This could result in increased costs if switching providers later becomes necessary due to unmet expectations.
7. Technical Skills: The team might lack experience with cloud-based databases which may require additional training, impacting productivity during the transition period; this can also lead to potential mistakes or misconfigurations that could result in data loss if not managed correctly by experienced personnel. 
8. Service Level Agreements (SLA): Ensuring uptime and performance levels through SLAs is crucial for a fintech startup, any breaches may impact customer trust severely; understanding the implications of these agreements before committing to cloud services should be thoroughly evaluated against on-premises alternatives.
9. Data Recovery: Cloud providers offer robust disaster recovery options but ensuring that they align with regulatory requirements and business continuity plans is essential for a fintech startup, which often requires immediate access to financial data in case of system failures or security breaches; this may require additional planning beyond what cloud services provide out-of-the-box.
1 endorsement from the provider's compliance documentation that they can meet these needs without incurring extra costs is essential before proceeding with migration.
