Using context windows larger than 16k tokens in enterprise knowledge bases offers benefits such as:

* Improved contextual understanding: More text can be used to analyze user queries, providing more accurate results.
* Enhanced entity recognition: Larger context can help identify entities and their relationships more effectively.

However, there are trade-offs:

* Increased computational resources: Processing larger contexts requires more powerful hardware and increased processing time.
* Risk of noise and ambiguity: Longer contexts may introduce extraneous information that can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant results.
